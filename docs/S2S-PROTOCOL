WhoisOnline Server to Server Protocol
======================================

  Every WhoisOnline chat server must be open to other chat servers by implementing this protocol.
  Opterators must not jail their users by shuting down this server to server protocol. You may
  filter or ratelimit some malicious servers for anti-spam measures. 

S2S Requirements
----------------

  You must fullfill the following requirements, to be part of the whoisonline network:

  .) You need a DNS domain. Every whoisonline server is authorative for at least one DNS domain.

  .) You need a webserver. This webserver must provide the following URL: 
        https://your.domain/wio.json
     or http://your.domain/wio.json

     Https is highly recommended. Http should only be used if you can't afford or are not
     allowed to use https on your server. Https might be ignored in the future by other server,
     if the users want a stricter privacy policy.

     The wio.json file format is described in chapter "WIO.JSON"

  .) You must implement the S2S-API and responde to requests from other servers

  .) You must implement the client side of the S2S-API and connect to other servers on
     user request.
